## Current Status

**Overall Progress:** ~96% (Core features complete, UI polished, performance optimized, production-ready)
**Last Session:** November 8, 2025 - Flight creation UX overhaul, weather intelligence, performance optimizations
**Next:** Final polish, testing, and deployment preparation

## Session Summary: November 8, 2025 - Flight Creation & Weather System Overhaul

### Major Improvements
1. **Intelligent Ceiling Estimation (Critical Bug Fix)**
   - Problem: All overcast skies defaulted to 500ft ceiling (unrealistic)
   - Solution: Advanced algorithm using cloud %, weather type, and visibility
   - Result: Realistic ceiling variation (500ft for fog → 25,000ft for clear → 6,000ft for high overcast)

2. **Complete FlightForm UI Redesign**
   - Modern purple gradient theme with smooth animations
   - Professional card design with glow effects
   - Enhanced buttons, spacing, typography
   - Custom scrollbar matching theme

3. **AI Search Table Redesign**
   - 3 clean columns: When | Safety | Issues
   - Badge-style safety display (✅ Safe 96%)
   - Pill-style issue tags
   - Instant row selection (click to populate form)

4. **Performance Optimization - Eliminated Double-Checking**
   - AI now caches all weather checkpoint data
   - Clicking table rows uses cached data (instant!)
   - Massive speedup: No redundant API calls

5. **Descriptive Training Levels**
   - Changed from "Level 1-4" to proper names
   - "Student Pilot", "Private Pilot", "Commercial Pilot", "Instrument Rated"

6. **Unified Reschedule Experience**
   - RescheduleModal now has same AI table as FlightForm
   - Same clickable rows, cached data, beautiful design

### Files Modified (8 files)

## Session Summary: December 2025 - 3D Model Support & Visualization Enhancements

### Features Implemented
1. **Custom 3D Plane Models**
   - Added support for .glb and .gltf file formats
   - Models stored in `public/assets/` folder
   - 5 aircraft models available: G3 JSC Air, Sierra ARC Air, WB57 JSC Air, C20A AFRC UAVSAR, G4 NOAA Air
   - Plane selector dropdown at top right of map
   - Models scale to 2000x for visibility

2. **Real-Time Model Switching**
   - Model changes update without restarting animation
   - Stable entity IDs based only on flight ID (not model URI)
   - Model URI updated dynamically via useEffect
   - Clock state preserved during model changes

3. **Visual Improvements**
   - Flight path lines made thinner (3px selected, 2px unselected)
   - Plane flies 300 feet above path line
   - Highlight dot positioned 25 feet below path line
   - Airport markers show only 3-letter codes with black stroke

4. **Follow Plane Optimizations**
   - Fixed camera lag by switching from requestAnimationFrame to postRender event
   - Zoom now targets plane position instead of mouse position
   - Added distance check (>1m) to reduce unnecessary updates
   - Camera updates synchronized with scene rendering

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Reduced position samples from 10 to 5 per segment
   - Camera follow handler only updates when plane moves significantly
   - Suppressed non-critical CORS/timeout errors from imagery tiles

6. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed duplicate React key warnings (unique keys for each component)
   - Fixed CORS errors from Bing Maps fallback tiles
   - Forced Ion World Imagery to prevent Bing Maps fallback
   - Added error handling for imagery provider failures

### Files Created (2 files)
| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/map/PlaneSelector.tsx` | Dropdown component for selecting plane models |
| `src/components/map/PlaneSelector.css` | Styling for plane selector component |

### Files Modified (4 files)
| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/map/AnimatedFlight.tsx` | Model support, highlight dot, position offsets, reduced samples |
| `src/components/map/CesiumMap.tsx` | Follow plane optimizations, imagery provider fixes, zoom handler |
| `src/components/map/AirportMarkers.tsx` | Billboard text with stroke, removed point markers |
| `public/assets/*.glb` | 5 aircraft model files added |

### Technical Insights Documented
- **Model Format:** Cesium supports .glb (binary GLTF) and .gltf (text GLTF) formats
- **Entity ID Strategy:** Stable IDs based on flight ID only, model URI updated dynamically
- **Camera Synchronization:** postRender event ensures camera updates match scene rendering
- **Performance:** Distance checks and reduced samples improve frame rates
- **Imagery Provider:** Ion World Imagery forced to prevent Bing Maps CORS issues

## Session Summary: December 2025 - Forecast Weather Enhancement

### Features Implemented
1. **Time-Based Weather Forecasts**
   - Weather now fetched for arrival time at each waypoint (not current weather)
   - Calculates arrival time: `departureTime + (distance / 120 knots) * 60 minutes`
   - Uses OpenWeatherMap forecast API (5-day, 3-hour intervals)
   - Finds closest forecast entry to waypoint arrival time
   - Falls back to current weather if forecast unavailable or > 5 days away

2. **Firebase Function Enhancement**
   - `getWeather` function now accepts optional `time` parameter (ISO string)
   - If time provided: fetches forecast and returns closest match
   - If time not provided: returns current weather (backward compatible)
   - Handles edge cases (time too far in future, API errors)

3. **Weather Service Update**
   - `getWeatherAtLocation()` accepts optional `time` parameter (Date or ISO string)
   - `checkFlightPath()` passes waypoint arrival times to weather service
   - Maintains backward compatibility (time parameter is optional)

### Files Modified (2 files)
| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `functions/src/index.ts` | Added forecast weather support with time parameter |
| `src/services/weatherService.ts` | Updated to pass waypoint arrival times for forecast weather |

### Technical Insights Documented
- **Forecast Weather Flow:** 
  1. Calculate waypoint arrival times based on distance and speed (120 knots)
  2. Pass arrival time to Firebase function
  3. Function fetches 5-day forecast (3-hour intervals)
  4. Finds closest forecast entry to target time
  5. Returns forecast weather for that time
- **OpenWeatherMap Limits:** Free tier forecast covers 5 days max
- **Fallback Strategy:** Current weather used if forecast unavailable or > 5 days
- **Backward Compatibility:** Time parameter optional, existing code still works

## Session Summary: November 8, 2025 (Animation & Camera Fixes)

### Issues Fixed
1. **Animation Auto-Restart Bug**
   - Problem: Flight animation would restart from beginning after landing
   - Solution: Changed Cesium clock range from LOOP_STOP (2) to CLAMPED (1)
   - Result: Animation now stops cleanly at destination

2. **Camera Globe Rotation**
   - Problem: Camera didn't rotate with Earth's curvature during long flights
   - Solution: Calculate and update camera orientation vectors (up, direction, right)
   - Result: Camera maintains proper orientation relative to Earth's surface

3. **Follow Button Behavior**
   - Problem: Follow mode locked camera completely, no manual control
   - Solution: Separate position tracking from orientation control
   - Enhancement: Added automatic top-down view initialization (100km above plane)
   - Result: Camera follows plane's position but user controls rotation/zoom

### Files Modified (2 files)
| File | Summary (5-6 words) |
|------|---------------------|
| `src/components/map/AnimatedFlight.tsx` | Clock range changed to CLAMPED |
| `src/components/map/CesiumMap.tsx` | Follow mode top-down view implementation |

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Animations end gracefully without restart
- ✅ Long-distance flights display correctly (no upside-down views)
- ✅ Follow button provides consistent top-down starting view
- ✅ Full camera control maintained while following plane
- ✅ Professional, smooth camera tracking behavior
